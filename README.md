#Computational Biology: 

Computational Biology studies the problems arising from Biology using algorithmic techniques. Typical problems include: sequencing and alignment of DNA and protein sequences; construction and comparison of evolutionary trees. These problems are of central importance in Biology. The course provides insights that will help students gain a comprehensive understanding of computational problems in Biology, and techniques for designing efficient algorithms for solving these problems.
